0DTE Options Strategy Backtesting System
Overview
This system lets you backtest a 0DTE (zero days to expiration) bull put spread options strategy using historical data from Alpaca and Databento. It automates the process of finding, simulating, and evaluating same-day expiry put spreads on underlying stock (default: SPY), with robust risk management and predefined trade logic.

Note: This backtesting system is supplemental to our tutorial guide How To Trade 0DTE Options with Alpaca's Trading API, which covers the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of 0DTE strategies using the live market data.

How It Works (Summary)
Setup: Connect to Alpaca and Databento API and set parameters.
Data Collection: Download historical stock (bar data) and options data (tick data) at 1-minute intervals for the backtesting window.
Trade Simulation:
Initialization:
Start scanning through historical market data chronologically from the earliest timestamp.
Option Analysis:
Calculate the options Greeks (delta) and Implied Volatility (IV) for each option symbol.
Find the first valid option pair that meets our trading criteria to build the bull put spread
Continuous Monitoring:
Perform these calculations every minute to identify suitable option legs.
Spread Formation:
Once suitable option legs are identified at the same timestamp, calculate the credits to be received and the total delta.
Trade Management:
Simulate entering the bull put spread.
Monitor for exit conditions such as profit targets, stop-loss triggers, or expiration.
Results: Aggregate and visualize the results for performance analysis.
Data Sources
Dual API Integration for Comprehensive Market Data:

Alpaca Trading API: Stock daily bars + 1-minute intraday data
Databento API: Options 1-minute tick data with bid/ask spreads
This combination provides both the underlying stock context and detailed options pricing needed for accurate 0DTE backtesting, leveraging each platform's strengths.

API Reference of Alpaca APIs
Note: This backtest requires both Alpaca’s Trading API and Databento's Historical API. In this demo, we use OPRA (Options Price Reporting Authority) equity options data from Databento, which can be accessed with usage-based pricing or through a subscription plan. Please review the following Databento resources below:

Equity options: Introduction
Installation
1. Prerequisites
Alpaca Trading API account
ALPACA_API_KEY and ALPACA_SECRET_KEY from your Alpaca dashboard
Check out our tutorial article: How to Start Paper Trading with Alpaca's Trading API
Databento API account (https://databento.com/signup)
DATABENTO_API_KEY from your Databento dashboard
Google Colab or Code Editor (IDE)
Python
Python package manager (e.g pip or uv)
2. Environment Configuration
The notebook has a code block that automatically detects whether it's running in Google Colab or a local code editor.

if 'google.colab' in sys.modules:
    # In Google Colab environment, we will fetch API keys from Secrets.
    # Please set ALPACA_API_KEY, ALPACA_SECRET_KEY, DATABENTO_API_KEY in Google Colab's Secrets from the left sidebar
    from google.colab import userdata
    ALPACA_API_KEY = userdata.get("ALPACA_API_KEY")
    ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = userdata.get("ALPACA_SECRET_KEY")
    DATABENTO_API_KEY = userdata.get("DATABENTO_API_KEY")
else:
    # Please safely store your API keys and never commit them to the repository (use .gitignore)
    # Load environment variables from environment file (e.g., .env)
    load_dotenv()
    # API credentials for Alpaca's Trading API and Databento API
    ALPACA_API_KEY = os.environ.get('ALPACA_API_KEY')
    ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('ALPACA_SECRET_KEY')
    DATABENTO_API_KEY = os.getenv("DATABENTO_API_KEY")
API keys are loaded differently based on the environment:

Google Colab: Uses Colab's Secrets feature (set keys in the left sidebar) .
Local IDE (e.g. VS Code, PyCharm): Uses environment variables from a .env file.
3. (For Google Colab Usage) Use Colab's Secrets feature to store environment variables
For Colab usage, you do not need to use an environment file like .env.

Open Google Colab, and go to Secrets.
Enter the Name (e.g., ALPACA_API_KEY) and Value for each API key. While the Value can be changed, the Name cannot be modified.
Toggle Notebook access.
For using them in the notebook, the notebook uses the given code with the name of your API keys.
from google.colab import userdata
ALPACA_API_KEY = userdata.get("ALPACA_API_KEY")
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = userdata.get("ALPACA_SECRET_KEY")
DATABENTO_API_KEY = userdata.get("DATABENTO_API_KEY")
3. (For Local IDE Usage) Create and edit a .env file in your project directory to store environment variables
Copy the example environment file in the project root by running this command:
cp .env.example .env
Insert your actual API keys in the .env file.
# Edit .env with your API keys
ALPACA_API_KEY=your_alpaca_api_key
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=your_alpaca_secret_key
ALPACA_PAPER_TRADE=True
DATABENTO_API_KEY=your_databento_api_key
4. Python Dependencies (Optional)
Note: If you're running the notebook in Google Colab, virtual environment setup is not necessary.

If you need to install any dependencies, use the following commands:

Option A: Using pip (traditional)

python3 -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myvenv\Scripts\activate
pip install databento alpaca-py python-dotenv pandas numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter ipykernel
Option B: Using uv (modern, faster)

To use uv, you'll first need to install it. See the official uv installation guide for detailed installation instructions for your platform.

uv venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate # On Windows: myvenv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install databento alpaca-py python-dotenv pandas numpy scipy matplotlib jupyter ipykernel
Verify installation:

ls -la /path/to/your/project/myvenv/bin/
For Cursor/VS Code: If your IDE doesn't auto-detect the virtual environment, manually select the Python interpreter (Cmd+Shift+P → "Python: Select Interpreter") and enter: /path/to/your/project/myvenv/bin/python

Bull Put Spread Strategy Overview
A bull put spread on 0DTE is a credit spread strategy using options that expire the same trading day, which profits when the underlying asset stays above the short strike price at expiration.

Structure:

Sell a higher-strike put (collect premium)
Buy a lower-strike put (limit risk)
Net result: Receive credit upfront

Long Put Delta: -0.40 to -0.20 (configurable)
Spread Width: $2-$4 (configurable)

Time Window: 9:30-16:00 ET for regular market hours (note: 16:15 ET for late close options contracts)
